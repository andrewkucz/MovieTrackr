# MovieTrackr

Simple React Application to track movies you have seen and movies you want to see. (Demo: https://movietrackr.herokuapp.com/) 

Developed over the course of a month (01/2020) for fun as practice and further exploration into React with hooks.

Uses MongoDB, Express, React, and NodeJS (full MERN stack).

Uses Auth0 for user registration/login (with Google account) and stores user on initial login.

Uses The Movie Database (TMDB https://www.themoviedb.org/) API to fetch new/popular movies and to search movies by string.
